I am taking MEAN App Development (CS591 D1) at Boston University for Spring 2019.

I am mainly a backend guy, but I am also interested in the most popular web development stack, so this is the motivation that pushed me to choose this course.

This repo contians all the course work I did! 

Check each individual folder for its discription!
