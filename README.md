# Mean App Development - Course Project

For Spring 2019, I am taking MEAN App Development (CS591 D1) at Boston University.

I am mainly a backend guy, but I am also interested in the most popular web development stack, so this is the motivation that i chose this course.

This repo contians all the course work I did!
